        I am a fresh graduate with a degree in Informatics Engineering from
        Universitas Muslim Indonesia, with a special interest in both Front End
        and Back End Web Development. During my studies, I participated in
        various bootcamps such as Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison, Lintasarta Cloudeka
        Digischool, and the Kampus Merdeka Independent Study Program, focusing
        on Web Development in collaboration with Dicoding. Additionally, I
        gained internship experience through the Kampus Merdeka program at Kalla
        Group as a Back End Developer, where I was responsible for building APIs
        for a tracking application.
